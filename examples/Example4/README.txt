Example 4 (different % of urgent jobs):

- AleaNG runs 3 workloads generated using different urgent settings (urgent jobs constitute 5%, 10% and 20% of all jobs, respectively). It uses EASY backfilling with preemption (with checkpointing).
-- workloads: Example4-load_100%-urgent_5%-instance_0.swf, Example4-load_100%-urgent_10%-instance_0.swf, Example4-load_100%-urgent_20%-instance_0.swf

- Uses preemption, does requeuing, and uses checkpointing
