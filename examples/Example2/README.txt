Example 2 (different scheduling algorithms + preemption):

- AleaNG runs 1 workload (load 100%) using three different scheduling algorithms (strict ordering, aggressive backfilling, EASY backfilling) and uses preemption to prioritize 10% of urgent jobs.
-- workloads: Example2-load_100%-urgent_10%-instance_0.swf

- Uses preemption, does requeuing but no checkpointing
